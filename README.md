## Description

PicrossVS allows people to challenge random players in a competitive battle to solve a Picross Board. Boards can be selected in sizes of 5x5,10x10,and 20x20 tiles per board. Also, people can choose to create a game for 1 up to 4 people at the same time. Each player gains points while they complete the board. But be careful, one mistake and you will lose points. There is an extra bonus score according to the order of completion of the game. If someone leaves a match, they will be penalized with a lot of points!

## Objective

We want to allow people to play picross (commonly known as nonograms) with their friends for the sake of spending their free time and having fun

## Tecnologies used

This project was developed using:

- **Mongo DB**: MongoDB was used as a NOSQL database. Here users,boards and games are stored. This implementation of Mongo DB is specific for Meteor (Meteor Mongo). https://docs.meteor.com/api/collections.html
- **React JS**: A Front End library useful for creating components. https://reactjs.org/
- **Node JS**: A javascript environment which allows to create a web server with javascript. https://nodejs.org
